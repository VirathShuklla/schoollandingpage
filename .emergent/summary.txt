**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a full-stack application with a React frontend. The backend has been migrated from a Python FastAPI server to Vercel Serverless Functions written in JavaScript to facilitate easy deployment on Vercel.

The application features:
-   A complete, multi-section landing page ().
-   A lead capture form modal ().
-   A Vercel serverless function () to process form submissions and send email notifications using the Resend API.
-   A basic admin dashboard () to view leads (currently fetches from the old, likely non-functional DB endpoint).
-   Configuration files (, ) to support Vercel deployment.
-   A  with deployment instructions.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: The user reported that after deploying to Vercel, the lead capture form shows an error upon submission. The agent identified that the form was incorrectly calling the old FastAPI backend endpoint instead of the new Vercel serverless function. The agent's last action was to update the API endpoint URL in  to .
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Manual testing. The agent needs to simulate a form submission on the frontend and check the browser's network tab to confirm the request is sent to  and receives a successful response. It cannot be fully tested without deploying to Vercel and checking function logs.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1**: Form submission fails on Vercel deployment (P0 - HIGHEST)

**Issues Detail**:
-   **Issue 1**:
    -   **Description**: After the user deployed the site to Vercel, submitting the lead capture form results in an error. The root cause was identified as the frontend making a request to the wrong API endpoint.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent updated the  URL in  from the hardcoded backend URL to the relative path , which Vercel should route to the serverless function.
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Verify that the change in  was correctly applied.
        2.  Take a screenshot and check the browser's console and network tabs during form submission to ensure the request is now hitting .
        3.  Confirm that the necessary environment variables for the email service () are mentioned in the deployment guide and are being set correctly on Vercel.
        4.  If the request hits the endpoint but fails, check the Vercel function logs for runtime errors within .
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is the core functionality of the application. Fixing it will make the lead capture system work on the production Vercel deployment.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y (The form has had functionality issues before, first with the SMTP backend, and now with the Vercel function integration).
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both. Frontend for the form interaction and Backend for the serverless function execution.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1**: Complete Vercel Deployment and Email Integration (P0)
    -   **Where to resume**: Verify the fix for the form submission error on Vercel.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: A fully functional, serverless landing page that can be deployed and maintained easily on Vercel, fulfilling the user's primary requirement.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both.
    -   **Blocked on something**: Final user verification on their Vercel environment.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks**:
    -   **P1**: **Admin Dashboard Enhancement**: The current admin dashboard is basic. It needs to be updated to manage leads effectively, potentially by fetching data from a database integrated with the Vercel function.
    -   **P2**: **Improve Feature Section UI**: The user requested to Make features look better. This is subjective and requires clarification from the user on specific design improvements.
-   **Future Tasks**:
    -   **A/B Test CTA Button Copy**: Implement A/B testing for different call-to-action button texts to optimize for higher conversion rates.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Architecture Migration**: Migrated backend logic from a persistent FastAPI server (using Gmail SMTP) to Vercel Serverless Functions (using Resend API) to enable serverless deployment.
- **UI & Copy Refinement**:
  - Rewrote and improved hero section copy for better impact.
  - Cleaned up the UI to be more minimalistic and professional based on user feedback.
  - Removed pricing clutter (e.g., ₹40,000 Value).
- **Bug Fixes & Chores**:
  - Removed the Made with Emergent watermark by deleting the script from  and adding a CSS override.
  - Resolved  vs. React 19 dependency conflict by updating  and switching Vercel's build process to use yarn install v1.22.22

- **Feature Implementation**:
  - Created a basic Admin Dashboard page ().
  - Generated a professional  file with deployment instructions.
  - Configured project for Vercel deployment (, ).

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- No major issues were missed; however, the Make features look better request is vague and has not been addressed pending user clarification.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- **Form Submission Failures**: The lead capture form has been a recurring point of failure. It initially had issues with the SMTP backend and now has integration issues with the Vercel serverless function.
- **Made with Emergent Watermark**: This required multiple attempts to remove completely, as it was being injected by an external script.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
-   **Backend**: Vercel Serverless Functions (Node.js)
-   **Email**: Resend API
-   **Deployment**: Vercel

**key DB schema**
The database is no longer in active use. The original FastAPI setup used a MongoDB  and  collection, but the current serverless architecture sends leads directly to email without database persistence.

**changes in tech stack**
-   **Backend**: Shifted from a persistent FastAPI (Python) server to Vercel Serverless Functions (JavaScript/Node.js).
-   **Email Service**: Migrated from Gmail SMTP to the Resend API for better scalability and deliverability in a serverless environment.

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains the client-side logic for form submission. This is where the API endpoint was just fixed.
-   : The Vercel serverless function that handles the email sending logic.
-   : Defines build configurations and routes for Vercel deployment.
-   : Was modified to remove the Made with Emergent script.
-   : Was modified to hide the watermark with CSS.
-   : Contains important setup and deployment instructions for the user.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The  directory contains the old FastAPI application, which is now deprecated. It should be removed to avoid confusion and streamline the codebase.
-   The  component still contains logic to fetch from the old database endpoint. It needs to be updated or redesigned for a serverless architecture (e.g., fetch from a new database or be removed if not a priority).

**key api endpoints**
-   : The active Vercel serverless function endpoint used by the lead capture form.
-    (DEPRECATED): The old FastAPI endpoint.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The project's backend has been fundamentally changed from a Python/FastAPI server to Vercel Serverless Functions to meet the user's requirement for easy Vercel deployment. Do not attempt to use or fix the old code in the  directory.
-   The email notification system now relies on the Resend API, not Gmail SMTP. The user will need a  configured as an environment variable in their Vercel project. This is a critical dependency for the core feature.
-   The current highest priority is to fix the form submission error on the live Vercel deployment. The fix likely involves verifying the frontend is calling the correct relative endpoint ().

7.  **user**: make the date-fns to date-fns: ^3, in the frontend folder
8.  **agent**: Acknowledges and applies the change.
9.  **user**: (Shares screenshot of the form) there is an error after I fill this form
10. **agent**: Identifies the form is failing because it's not deployed on Vercel yet and reverts the endpoint to the local FastAPI backend temporarily.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**: The core feature, lead capture via the form on the Vercel deployment, is not working.
-   **Mocked**: No components are currently mocked.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Calendly**: Badge widget for scheduling demos.
-   **Resend**: Used by the Vercel serverless function for sending email notifications. Requires a User API Key ().
-   **Vercel**: The target deployment platform for the entire application.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes**: NO. A testing agent was not used after the major refactoring from FastAPI to Vercel Serverless Functions, which contributed to the current integration bug.
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO
-   **Test files created**: None.
-   **Known regressions**: Form submission functionality regressed after the Vercel migration.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   The user provided a Gmail App Password () for the old, now-deprecated SMTP setup.
-   For the current Resend setup to work, the user must provide a **Resend API Key** and configure it as an environment variable () in their Vercel project.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent did not run a full end-to-end test after refactoring the backend to Vercel Serverless Functions, leading to the current form submission bug on deployment.
-   The agent did not explicitly re-confirm with the user that a  is required and must be added to Vercel's environment variables. This is a critical unhandled dependency.</analysis>
